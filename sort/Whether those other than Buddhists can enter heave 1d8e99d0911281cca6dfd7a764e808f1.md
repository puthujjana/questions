# Whether outsiders can enter heaven?

In Brief:

Yes, outsiders can enter heaven. Whether or not it is probable, or whether or not they can attain Nibbāna, is another matter<!-- insert link to article on this -->.

In Full:

Yes, outsiders can enter heaven. Whether or not it is probable, or whether or not they can attain Nibbāna, is another matter<!-- insert link to article on this -->. That outsiders can enter heaven can be known by three ways:
(1) The explicit statements in the Canon
(2) The existence of heavenly beings before and during the Buddha's dispensation
(3) Inference from conditions for heavenly rebirth described in the Canon

Let us examine each way in turn.

(1) The explicit statements in the Canon
Explicit statements in the Canon are those where this particular question or a similar one is directly asked and answered. 

At MN 71<!-- pts citation -->, the Buddha was asked by Vacchagota whether or not any Ājīvaka ascetics (an ascetic sect outside of the Buddha's dispensation<!-- references to further readings on the Ajivakas-->) had ever entered heaven:

"Master Gotama, is there any Ājīvaka who, on the dissolution of the body, has gone to heaven?"
"When I recollect the past ninety-one aeons, Vaccha, I do not recall any Ājīvaka who, on the dissolution of the bdoy, went to heaven, with one exception, and he held the doctrine of the moral efficacy of action, the doctrine of the moral efficacy of deeds." (Bodhi, pp.589<!-- cite properly -->)

"atthi pana, bho gotama, koci ājīvako kāyassa bhedā saggūpago"ti? 
"ito kho so, vaccha, ekanavuto kappo yamahaṃ anussarāmi, nābhijānāmi kañci ājīvakaṃ saggūpagaṃ aññatra ekena, sopāsi kammavādī kiriyavādī"ti.

Here, the Buddha explicitly acknowledges that there was an outsider who entered heaven; and thus, this is the first way by which it can be known that outsiders can enter heaven.


(2) That there were heavenly beings already existing during the Buddha's dispensation


(3) Reflection on the conditions for heavenly rebirth described in the Canon

This refers to the conditions for heavenly rebirth that were explicitly and clearly listed in the Canon, such as refraining from taking life.

At MN 41, the Buddha lists the ten conditions (dasakusalakammapatha<!-- three forms of right conduct? -->) for a heavenly rebirth:

<!-- English translation -->

"tividhaṃ kho, gahapatayo, kāyena dhammacariyāsamacariyā hoti, catubbidhaṃ vācāya dhammacariyāsamacariyā hoti, tividhaṃ manasā dhammacariyāsamacariyā hoti.

 "evaṃ dhammacariyāsamacariyāhetu kho, gahapatayo, evamidhekacce sattā kāyassa bhedā paraṃ maraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ upapajjanti.

 Here, it can be seen that the conditions the Buddha listed for a heavenly rebirth do not include being a sāvaka. Now, we must not indulge the facile assumption that this sutta definitively proves that these conditions are sufficient for a heavenly rebirth; and thus it is definitive evidence that outsiders can be reborn in heaven. <!-- For instance, MN 135 or 136 where the Buddha talks about good and bad people having bad and good destinations -->However, it seems prima facie reasonable to defeasibly assume from this list that an outsider who fulfills these conditions can be reborn in heaven, in the absense of defeating evidence; and thus, this is the second way by which it can be known that outsiders can enter heaven.
