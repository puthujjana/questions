# Whether the observance of the thirteen dhutaṅgā is necessary for the attainment Arahatta?

The observance of the thirteen dhutaṅgā is not necessary for the attainment of Arahatta, for it is said:

Puna caparaṁ, bhikkhave, asappuriso

āraññiko hoti….

paṁsukūliko hoti….

piṇḍapātiko hoti….

rukkhamūliko hoti….

sosāniko hoti….

abbhokāsiko hoti….

nesajjiko hoti….

yathāsanthatiko hoti….

ekāsaniko hoti. 

So iti paṭisañcikkhati: ‘ahaṁ khomhi ekāsaniko, ime panaññe bhikkhū na ekāsanikā’ti. So tena ekāsanikattena attānukkaṁseti, paraṁ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, asappurisadhammo. Sappuriso ca kho, bhikkhave, iti paṭisañcikkhati: ‘na kho ekāsanikattena lobhadhammā vā parikkhayaṁ gacchanti, dosadhammā vā parikkhayaṁ gacchanti, mohadhammā vā parikkhayaṁ gacchanti. No cepi ekāsaniko hoti; so ca hoti dhammānudhammappaṭipanno sāmīcippaṭipanno anudhammacārī, so tattha pujjo, so tattha pāsaṁso’ti. So paṭipadaṁyeva antaraṁ karitvā tena ekāsanikattena nevattānukkaṁseti, na paraṁ vambheti. Ayampi, bhikkhave, sappurisadhammo.

([MN 113](https://suttacentral.net/mn113/pli/ms?lang=en&layout=linebyline&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin))

*Furthermore, take an untrue person* 

who dwells in the wilderness….

*who is a rag robe wearer….*

*who eats only almsfood….*

*who stays at the root of a tree….*

*who stays in a charnel ground….*

*who stays in the open air….*

*who never lies down….*

*who sleeps wherever they lay their mat….*

*who eats in one sitting per day.* 

*They reflect: ‘I eat in one sitting per day, unlike these other mendicants.’ And they glorify themselves and put others down on account of that. This too is a quality of an untrue person. A true person reflects: ‘It’s not because of eating in one sitting per day that thoughts of greed, hate, or delusion come to an end. Even if someone eats in more than one sitting per day, if they practice in line with the teaching, practice properly, and live in line with the teaching, they are worthy of honor and praise for that.’ Keeping the practice to themselves, they don’t glorify themselves and put others down on account of their eating in one sitting per day. This too is a quality of a true person.*

     To conclude from this passage that the thirteen dhutaṅgā are not necessary, two assumptions must be granted: (1) that such remarks also apply to the four other dhutaṅgā not mentioned in this sutta; (2) that “lobhadhammā [and so on for dosadhammā and mohadhammā] vā parikkhayaṁ gacchanti” is equivalent to “rāgakkhayo dosakkhayo mohakkhayo”, which is Nibbāna ([SN 38.1](https://suttacentral.net/sn38.1/pli/ms?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)).
