# Whether an Arahant can emit semen?

In Brief:

No. An Arahant cannot emit semen.

In Full:

No. An Arahant cannot emit semen. That an Arahant cannot emit semen can be known by at least one way:
(1) Explicit statements in the Canon
<!-- (2) Inference based on the nature of Arahatta -->

Let us examine it.

(1)

At Mv.8.16, the Buddha is told by Venerable Ānanda that some bhikkhus had unmindfully emitted semen on some furniture while sleeping. The Buddha then proceeds to expound the five drawbacks of going to sleep unmindfully, concluding with this remark:

<!-- English translation -->
<!-- My own -->
<!-- This case, Ānanda, is impossible: that semen would be released from an Arahant. (or, that an Arahant's semen would be released) -->
aṭṭhānametaṃ, ānanda, anavakāso yaṃ arahato asuci mucceyyā"’ti.

Here, the Buddha explicitly denies that an Arahant can emit semen; and thus, this is one way by which it can be known that an Arahant cannot emit semen.

<!-- Notes -->

<!-- Worth investigating the physiology. Can semen ever be emitted without sexual arousal? This would be for a second way, but I don't know the physiology. -->
