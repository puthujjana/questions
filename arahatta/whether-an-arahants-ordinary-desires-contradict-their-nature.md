Notes:

The question is basically this: if an Arahant is free from desire, then how can he, say, desire the welfare of all beings, or desire to teach, as in the case of some Arahants who choose to teach? I currently have two responses that I'll sketch roughly: (1) the question equivocates on two senses of the words desire - (1) desire as lust or passion or craving; (2) desire as just intention, or inclination or disposition of mind, or preference itself - and when those two senses are distinguished the problem disscolves; (2) one could question whether or not an Arahant actually has, even in sense (2), any desires or, rather, merely by nature, not by active desiring, inclines to certain things and away from others.
