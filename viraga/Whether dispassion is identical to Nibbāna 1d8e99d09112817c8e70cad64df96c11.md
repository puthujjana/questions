**Notes:**

There are a couple of stock descriptions that I feel are relevant to this discussion. One, which appears in the famous Fire Sermon:

*nibbindaṁ virajjati **virāgā vimuccati** vimuttasmiṁ vimuttamiti ñāṇaṁ hoti*

*khīṇā jāti vusitaṁ brahmacariyaṁ kataṁ karaṇīyaṁ nāparaṁ itthattāyāti pajānātīti* (SN 35.28; bold added)

     It is not entirely certain in what temporal mode this excerpt should be interpreted. That is to say, should it be interpreted as sequential, describing a sequence of events occurring in succession in time, or should it be interpreted as simultaneous, describing events occurring simultaneously in time? Though in the latter case, there might not be any temporal priority among the events, there might still be a causal, structural, or logical priority, just as, though the foundation of a building and its successive stories exist simultaneously, each preceding story is structurally prior to its successor,  every story ultimately being structurally grounded by the foundation. Thus, even if it is granted that the above excerpt describes simultaneous events, it might still be that those events stand in some relation to one another and are distinct. It seems plausible that the quote should be taken literally, and thus that dispassion is a proximate step in the attainment of Nibbāna, and thus not identical to it, though nonetheless closely related and indispensable to it.

Another relevant stock description:

*Tassa mayhaṁ, bhikkhave, etadahosi: ‘nāyaṁ dhammo nibbidāya na virāgāya na nirodhāya na upasamāya na abhiññāya na sambodhāya na nibbānāya saṁvattati*

*‘This Dhamma does not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna…*(MN 26; Bodhi)

It seems this quote might more or less settle the issue:

*Yampissa taṁ, bhikkhave, khayasmiṁ khaye ñāṇaṁ, tampi saupanisaṁ vadāmi, no anupanisaṁ. Kā ca, bhikkhave, khaye ñāṇassa upanisā? ‘Vimuttī’tissa vacanīyaṁ.* 

*Vimuttimpāhaṁ, bhikkhave, saupanisaṁ vadāmi, no anupanisaṁ. Kā ca, bhikkhave, vimuttiyā upanisā? ‘Virāgo’tissa vacanīyaṁ.*

*‘“I say, bhikkhus, that the knowledge of destruction in regard to destruction has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for the knowledge of destruction? It should be said: liberation.*

*“I say, bhikkhus, that liberation too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for liberation? It should be said: dispassion….’* ([SN 12.23; Bodhi](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.23/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false))

Although the relationship between vimutti and Nibbāna hasn’t yet been clarified, it is assumed that they are identical (though it seems if this isn’t assumed, then the case would be stronger for the non-identity here); thus, in the absence of reason to think otherwise, it seems reasonable to assume that virāga is distinct from Nibbāna, but is nonetheless its most proximate cause and thus serves a most integral role.
