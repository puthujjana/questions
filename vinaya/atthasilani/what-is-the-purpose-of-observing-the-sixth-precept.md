(3) Physical
(4) Practical

In Full:

There are at least four reasons for observing the sixth precept, the last of which doesn't derive directly from the Canon:
(1) Ascetical<!-- for lack of a better term -->
(2) Conventional
(3) Physical
(4) Practical

That there are at least four reasons for observing the sixth precept can be know by three ways:
(1) Explicit statements
(2) Inference
(3) Independent reflection

Let us examine each reason and the ways by which it may known in turn.

(1) Ascetical

This refers to the observance of the sixth precept as an ascetic practice for the sake of abandoning unskillful qualities and cultivating skillful qualities. In particular, the sixth precept is a skillful expedient for abandoning sensual craving and attachment in regard to food, and for cultivating contentment and fewness of wishes.

At MN 3, the Buddha describes a hypothetical scenario in which two of his disciples, weak and afflicted with hunger, approach him just as he, the Buddha, is finishing his meal.
