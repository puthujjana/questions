 Category: Sukha
Sutta References: ITI 49, MN 111, MN 139, MN 66
Answer: -
Notes: What should also be added are references to suttas wherein the Buddha is described as abiding in jhāna. There is also of course the fact that the jhāna’s are included in the Noble Eightfold Path. I do wonder, though, if there is not a more explicit statement in the Canon along these lines.

The Buddha did not disapprove of all pleasure, for it is said explicitly:

Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vivicceva kāmehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi savitakkaṁ savicāraṁ vivekajaṁ pītisukhaṁ paṭhamaṁ jhānaṁ upasampajja viharati. Vitakkavicārānaṁ vūpasamā ajjhattaṁ sampasādanaṁ cetaso ekodibhāvaṁ avitakkaṁ avicāraṁ samādhijaṁ pītisukhaṁ dutiyaṁ jhānaṁ upasampajja viharati. Pītiyā ca virāgā upekkhako ca viharati …pe… tatiyaṁ jhānaṁ …pe… catutthaṁ jhānaṁ upasampajja viharati. Idaṁ vuccati nekkhammasukhaṁ pavivekasukhaṁ upasamasukhaṁ sambodhisukhaṁ. ‘Āsevitabbaṁ, bhāvetabbaṁ, bahulīkātabbaṁ, na bhāyitabbaṁ etassa sukhassā’ti—vadāmi. ([MN 113](https://suttacentral.net/mn139/pli/ms?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin))

*Monks, here a monk who is secluded from sensuality and secluded from unwholesome phenomena attains and remains in the first jhāna, which has thought, has consideration, and has rapture and happiness produced by seclusion. With the tranquilizing of thought and consideration, he attains and remains in the second jhāna, which has internal composure, mental unification, is free of thought, is free of consideration, and has rapture and happiness produced by concentration. With the dissipation of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, and clearly aware, experiencing pleasure with the body; what the noble ones describe as ‘Equanimous, mindful, and dwelling happily’ – he attains and remains in the third jhāna. With the abandoning of pleasure, the abandoning of pain, and the previous disappearance of elation and dejection, he attains and remains in the fourth jhāna, which has neither pain nor pleasure, and has purity of mindfulness and equanimity. This is called the pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of tranquility, the pleasure of awakening. I say that such pleasure is to be cultivated, is to be developed, is to be made much of; such pleasure is not to be regarded as dangerous.* ([MN 139](https://suttacentral.net/mn139/en/suddhaso?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false))

As a general rule, as is manifest in the Sevitabbāsevitabba Sutta ([MN 114](https://suttacentral.net/mn114/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)), something is to be cultivated if it conduces to the growth of skillful qualities and the decline of unskillful qualities, and something is not to be cultivated if it conduces to the decline of skillful qualities and the growth of unskillful qualities; and pleasure here is not an exception.
