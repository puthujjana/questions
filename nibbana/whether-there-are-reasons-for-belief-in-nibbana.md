Notes:
Discuss the reasoning Joe Schmid has discussed, which is along these lines: that if something varies only in degrees from something that exists, then it is possible. Perhaps, if Nibbāna is just the extinction of the defilements, then this might just be a variance in degree of the defilements we already experience, and thus, perhaps, is possible. -->
