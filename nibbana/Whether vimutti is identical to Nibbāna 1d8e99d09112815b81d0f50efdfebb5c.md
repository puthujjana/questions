**Notes:**

The answer is not entirely clear. A common stock description says:

*nibbindaṁ virajjati virāgā vimuccati **vimuttasmiṁ vimuttamiti ñāṇaṁ hoti***

*khīṇā jāti vusitaṁ brahmacariyaṁ kataṁ karaṇīyaṁ nāparaṁ itthattāyāti pajānātīti* (SN 35.28; bold added)

Also:

Yampissa taṁ, bhikkhave, khayasmiṁ khaye ñāṇaṁ, tampi saupanisaṁ vadāmi, no anupanisaṁ. Kā ca, bhikkhave, khaye ñāṇassa upanisā? ‘Vimuttī’tissa vacanīyaṁ. 

*Vimuttimpāhaṁ, bhikkhave, saupanisaṁ vadāmi, no anupanisaṁ. Variant: Vimuttimpāhaṁ vimuttimpahaṁ. Kā ca, bhikkhave, vimuttiyā upanisā? ‘Virāgo’tissa vacanīyaṁ.*

“I say, bhikkhus, that the knowledge of destruction in regard to destruction has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for the knowledge of destruction? It should be said: liberation.

*“I say, bhikkhus, that liberation too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for liberation? It should be said: dispassion….*([SN 12.23; Bodhi](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.23/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false))

Various questions arise: (1) since Nibbāna is asaṅkhata (unconditioned; UD 8??), then mustn’t it be distinct from vimutti in this case, since vimutti is said to have a cause, granted the word used in the above excerpt is “upanisaṃ”, not “saṅkhāra”?; (2) moreover, since vimutti is said to be the cause of something else, namely, knowledge of destruction, does that also indicate that it is distinct from Nibbāna
